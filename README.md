Sales Tracking App is a Java desktop application that allows salespeople to track their sales and commissions. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store information about products, customers, salespeople, and sales.


## Running the Application

To run the application, you'll need to have Java 8 and PostgreSQL installed on your system. You'll also need to have the JavaFX library added to your project.

To add the JavaFX library, follow these steps:

1. Download the JavaFX SDK from the official website: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory on your computer.
3. In Eclipse, right-click on your project in the Project Explorer and select Properties.
4. In the Properties dialog, select Java Build Path from the left-hand menu.
5. Click on the Libraries tab, then click Add Library.
6. Select User Library, then click Next.
7. Click on the User Libraries... button, then click New.
8. Give your new library a name (e.g. JavaFX), then click OK.
9. With your new library selected, click Add External JARs...
10. Navigate to the lib folder in the JavaFX SDK directory you extracted earlier, and select all the JAR files in that folder.
11. Click OK to close all the dialog boxes.

Now you should be able to run the application by right-clicking on the Main.java file and selecting Run As > Java Application.
